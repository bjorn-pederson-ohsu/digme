					<h1>Course Work</h1>
					<p>This program is designed to cover the standards and curriculum requirements for Minneapolis schools and Roosevelt High School in a way that will allow DigMe students flexibility and choice in their learning in their core classes: math, English, social studies and science classes. Courses are being designed with interdisciplinary units of study.Students will:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>develop and use critical thinking abilities</li>
						<li>participate in daily reading, writing, analyzing, and discussion activities </li>
						<li>complete exercises to stretch their creativity </li>
						<li>design and produce projects which demonstrate learning in a variety of ways, often involving the use of digital media tools</li>
					</ul>
					<p> Teachers will instruct using digital tools, and students will get hands on practice in producing their own digital products. Some of these tools include computers, the internet, cameras, voice recorders, and video recorders. Some student products include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>on line magazines and graphic novels</li>
						<li>podcasts and recorded interviews</li>
						<li>documentary films and news video programs</li>
						<li>photography portfolios</li>
						<li>web pages and blogs</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Many of the polished pieces produced by students this year will be showcased in live community performances and presentations as well as on the internet or even cable access TV!</p>
