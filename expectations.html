					<h1>Expectations</h1>
					<p>Student- The most important expectation of students in DigMe is that they become empowered about their own learning. We believe learning should be approached with a sense of discovery and students should be prepared to question and hypothesize, problem solve, and teach each other. Every student is capable of succeeding. It is important that every student grow as a reader, writer, scientist, historian, mathematician, artist and thinker. Students are expected to behave in a scholarly manner, to work to the best of their ability and to approach learning with enthusiasm. </p>
					<p>Teacher- DigMe teachers have all made the commitment to teach in this program and to put forth their best effort to guide students and help them succeed.  Do not hesitate to come to the teachers, coordinators or dean with questions, concerns, or for additional help on course work. We are all available by email and in person for students and families.</p>
					<p>Students are expected to complete assigned homework by the assigned due date to receive credit. To earn a passing grade in all courses students must earn a minimum of 60%. Each teacher will provide more information about specifics in their classes.</p>
					<p>The DigMe program expects 95% attendance from the students. This means missing no more than 2 days per quarter. Students who are absent more than 2 days per quarter will be referred for further intervention.</p>
					<p>Please be aware that attendance affects a student’s grade. Many of the projects in DigMe classes are group projects. Every student’s voice matters in our community and class participation is expected. Students with poor attendance may not be able to fully engage in certain classroom activities which are key to the program.</p>
